# MAJOR 2: BROWSER ISOLATION USING DOCKER
The objective of this project is to create a prototype client-side isolated browser using docker.

Browser isolation using Docker is an effective and practical solution for ensuring the 
security of remote workforces. Its increasing adoption by companies reflects its effectiveness 
and value in protecting against cyber threats while enabling remote work and productivity in 
the digital age. As the trend of remote work continues to grow, the importance of browser 
isolation using Docker is likely to increase as well, highlighting the need for secure and 
efficient solutions to support the new paradigm of work.

The various platform, tools and languages used for executing the project are mentioned below:
- Integrated Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
- Programming Language: Python
- Tool: Docker
